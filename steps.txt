#It will log everything related to below hashtag
option1: 
twarc2 search '#education -is:retweet' --start-time 2021-01-01 --end-time 2022-01-31 --limit 5000 --archive

option2: save to jsonl file. 

twarc2 search '#education' --start-time 2021-01-01 --end-time 2022-01-31 --limit 5000 tweets.jsonl

Flatten the file: 
twarc2 flatten tweets.jsonl flattened-tweets.jsonl

#We will use twarc-csv to conver jsonl file to csv to make it readable in a dataframe and easy to perform our analysis. 

twarc2 csv tweets.jsonl tweets.csv

Once you have the csv file, load the csv in to dataframe.
